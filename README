Jan Moesen’s bookmarklets

A collection of time-saving and life-enhancing (ahem) bookmarklets.

These bookmarklets are used for various purposes, but they all share the same
goal: make web browsing and development easier and more efficient.

I like giving my bookmarklets keywords so I can use my address bar as a
command line. (If you speak Dutch, check out this presentation from 2011:

The bookmarklets are stored here as separate script files. You can copy and
paste them into your bookmarks manager, or import them wholesale using the
generated `bookmarks.html` file.
